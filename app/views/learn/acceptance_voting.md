# Acceptance Voting

Acceptance voting is a voting method designed to mirror the way that groups naturally make group decisions that require negotiation. It is similar to [approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting), but with a distinction between acceptance and preference. In the context of negotiation, acceptance is the primary factor in determining the outcome, and preference is secondary. The goal of the process is to find an option that everyone finds acceptable, even if different people prefer different options.

Acceptance voting first narrows down the list of options to what people are willing to accept. If there are multiple options that everyone finds equally acceptable, then preference is taken into account to determine the outcome.

__Decisions__ in Harmonic Team use acceptance voting in order to converge on the path of greatest acceptance as quickly as possible.
