# Awareness Indicators

Awareness indicators are things that communicate awareness of some given information. A simple example is emoji reactions in chat apps like Discord or Slack. When someone reacts to a message with an emoji, the mere presence of that reaction indicates that the person who reacted is aware of the message. If they had read the message but not reacted, it would be ambiguous whether or not they were aware of the message.

From a group coordination perspective, information is often not actionable until people know that other people know the information. In other words, it's possible for everyone in a group to know the information and yet not be able to act on it if they don't know who else knows.

__Notes__ in Harmonic Team include a confirmation button to signal awareness. This makes the information more actionable because it makes it clear who knows about the information.
