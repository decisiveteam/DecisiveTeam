# Reciprocal Commitment

Reciprocal commitment is commitment that is conditional on all participants making the same commitment.

__Commitments__ in Harmonic Team have an explicit critical mass threshold that must be reached in order for the commitment to take effect. It's a mechanism that is similar to a Kickstarter campaign, except people pledge their participation rather than money.
